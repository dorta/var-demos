✓ means tested on the connected boards. N/A means not enabled. This does not certify
continuous operation. MX93 uses CPU-decoded MJPEG, not H.264.
Both buildings clips are available in 720p and 1080p; 720p is the default.
Face menus use the separate City Selfie clip. See
[Face Detection](face-detection.md) for its shared menus and model preparation.
MX95 camera mode requires the OV5640 to initialize successfully; the current
sensor has a power/probe failure.

| Camera capture choice | i.MX 8M Plus | i.MX 93 | i.MX 95 |

| VGA 640×480 | ✓ | ✓ (default) | ✓ |
| SD 720×480 | ✓ (default) | N/A | N/A |
| HD 1280×720 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (default) |
| Full HD 1920×1080 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

These choices were checked with the connected OV5640 cameras for both
classification and detection. They are capture modes, not a promise of
30 FPS at every resolution or compatibility with other sensors.
Every camera entry in the manager, including face detection and experimental
hand gestures, opens this selector. The fixed CAMERA panel below FPS shows
capture dimensions even if processing subsequently resizes the frame.
The selector describes the configured OV5640/BSP modes, not automatic discovery
of arbitrary replacement cameras. MX95's earlier capture-mode checks do not
override the sensor failure observed during the latest face-demo tests.
